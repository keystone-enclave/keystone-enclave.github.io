description: Summary of the Open-Source Enclaves Workshop on July 25th 2019
---

We had a fantastic [Open-Source Enclaves
Workshop](https://keystone-enclave.org/open-source-enclaves-workshop/)
(OSEW 2019) last week (July 25th) at UC Berkeley hosted by the
Keystone team. OSEW aims to bring the architecture and
systems-security community together to make progress towards building
open-source, secure, performant enclaves. This year, we discussed the
different threat models, the components for secure enclaves, best
practices and state-of-the-art techniques for each component, and open
problems in this space.

OSEW 2019 featured 25 talks from 23 organizations across academia and
industry as well as an in-depth industry discussion panel. After more
than 150+ registrations from 14 countries from all over the world,
over 120 attendees participated in the workshop.

Our predictiction is that “In the next 10 years, most chips will have
secure enclave capability”. As one of the first key steps towards
safer and open enclaves, we
[announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3etcxOzZXU) the start of
the Trustworthy Secure Enclaves Alliance; a partnership of different
entities in the secure hardware and software space to help distribute
trust in future platforms. Our aim with this effort is to be better
prepared for the surge of secure enclave capabilities and to
gracefully embrace the future TEEs, while doing all of it as a
community. You can read more about our plans in the [draft
charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Njd3ftyQJFzzZpoSX0mD4sHTyTy4myXZFsdjWYI7WDg/edit?usp=sharing).


# Talk Highlights

## Keystone

Dayeol’s [update
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoERuxbcci4) on the Keystone
project, an effort towards building a fully open-source framework for
trusted execution environments (TEEs) based on hardware enclaves. The
talk introduced "customizable TEEs", a new model for building TEEs,
where one can compose various building blocks of TEEs depending on the
threat models or the use cases. It also explained how Keystone is
designed with RISC-V to implement minimal hardware-enforced isolation
and showcased modular plugins built on top of it. Checkout the full
[Keystone paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10119) and our open source
[code](https://github.com/keystone-enclave).


##  RISC-V, TEEs, and Rust

Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi from TU Darmstadt gave an excellent witty talk on
hardware bugs, finding bugs with competitions, and a very useful
categorization of various TEE solutions. Cesare Garlati from Hex-Five
Security gave an engaging talk on [multi zone
enclave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1EhF87la68) using RISC-V.

A recurring theme of the workshop was how to make the code run in
enclaves safer regardless of the specific TEE. [Mingshen
Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJuiOb8HJ9A) from Baidu X-Lab
discussed their efforts on bringing Rust support to Keystone, as well
as their general Mesa TEE platform. Similarly, we heard from [Jethro
Beekman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqeRQ5-_ALk) of Fortanix
about their approach to Rust SDKs for enclaves on SGX.

## Verification

Verification was another recurring topic which came up in various
presentations and Q&A sessions. A [couple of 
talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWekd4qMsto) 
[from UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNYf78zkWdI) and one from
[UW](https://keystone-enclave.org/open-source-enclaves-workshop/slides/OSEW19_LukeNelson_UW.pdf)
show-cased new verification tools and techniques for TEEs in general
and covered targeted efforts tailored for RISC-V platforms. Given the
importance of verification and amazing on-going work, this area of
research is emerging as an exciting space to watch out for.

## Side-channels and Speculation

Another contemporary and timely topic was on side-channel attacks and
defenses, with a pair of talks [Chris
Fletcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXQSGUjLab4) and [Josep
Torrellas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Z71M2-W8U) of UIUC on
defenses for speculative attacks like Spectre. General
compiler-assisted tooling for these defenses are a welcome addition to
any sensitive program, especially since enclaves operate with an
attacker controlling everything needed for Spectre-family attacks. As
a wrap-up to the topic, [Yinqian
Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSYGzf9xAmA) from The Ohio
State University gave an excellent overview of the variety of
side-channel threats known to Intel’s SGX and AMD’s SEV.

There were many other interesting talks from industry speakers
including [HTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK5WTOwf2A0),

# Panel Discussion

Finally, we had a [panel
discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUos-CohJ6c) where panel
members engaged in an open discussion on various pressing questions of
security of emerging TEEs. We were fortunate to have Paul Chou (Senior
Director of Platform Security at Nvidia), Paul Kocher (Independent
Security Researcher and Entrepreneur), Justin Lin (Security Architect
at HTC), Frank McKeen (Sr. Principal Engineer at Intel Labs), and
Satyam Srivastava (Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Intel) as our
panel members. Thanks to Krste Asanović for moderating the discussion.

To kick start the discussion, each panel member spoke briefly about
what worries them the most right now. Side-channel vulnerabilities,
taking the TEE conversation beyond CPUs, and things being binary in
our minds when security is a probabilistic thing were the highlights
of everyone’s concerns. Then they discussed why a lot of known best
practices aren't being implemented and how we can solve known problems
before we solve new issues. The discussion circled around this being
mostly an economic problem governed by incentive. Prompted by a
question from the audience, panel members discussed the possibility of
introducing security levels for software as is being done for
self-driving cars. They noted that compliance to regulation is more of
a passing criterion than a differentiator when it comes to
security. Next, the members expressed their vision for the right model
for enclave-capable accelerators and how to extend CPU TEE to these
emerging class of devices. The unanimous response was that it will be
highly dictated by the use-case. Lastly, panel members discussed
corner-case scenarios such as the response to a secure boot failure,
where real-world decisions post-failure are unclear. The discussion
ended on a positive note that security failures are inevitable and
we're not going to get things right the first time. The only recourse
is to embrace this fact, have mitigations in place to handle and patch
failures gracefully, learn from the failures, and address them in the
best way possible.

A big thank you to our sponsors Western Digital and Seagate for their
support, a shout-out to our admins Tami and Ria from the ADEPT lab for
all the hard work and help in organizing the workshop, and cheers to
all our attendees and speakers who made OSEW’19 a successful event
with their active participation.
